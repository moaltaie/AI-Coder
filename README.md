<h4>A script that uses artificial intelligence to help programmers and hackers write some scripts or solve some problems they encounter.</h4>

<h7>
This text was created by individual effort, and it is my first work in this aspect of AI. I hope it helps you with something.
<br>
When using AI, make your question simple and detailed to get a logical answer without problems.
<br>
If you do not like the way it works or you encounter errors, you can modify it to develop it to a better level.
<br>
By the way, the script provides answers and scripts related to penetration and other things without barriers or obstacles.
<br>
enjoy it .
